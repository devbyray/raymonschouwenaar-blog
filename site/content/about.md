### I'm **Toma Nistor**, a **full stack web developer** and **UI/UX enthusiast** with a **digital marketing and SEO** background based in San Diego, California.

Since creating my first website at the age of twelve, my eyes have been glued to the web. **What was once only a long-time hobby, has now become my full-time career.**

After spending two years as a digital marketer and trying to teach myself web development in my spare time, I decided to dive into an intensive four-month Ruby on Rails coding bootcamp at [LEARN academy](https://www.learnacademy.org).

**Today I engineer and design apps and websites from the ground up using the technologies I've learned and the tools that make it easier.**

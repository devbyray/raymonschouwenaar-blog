Hi! I'm Raymon and I'm working as a Senior Frontend Developer.

I love to work with HTML5, CSS3, NodeJS, NPM scripts, (Vanilla) JavaScript, GruntJS, GulpJS, Bower, Sass/SCSS/PostCSS,AngularJS 1.5 & 2, Typescript, Responsive, Git, Vue.js.

Special message for recruiters: **Java is NOT JavaScript! I don’t do Java development but JavaScript Development!!!!**

I’m super passionated about helping others with getting better in Frontend Development. Helping them to get better tech & soft skills, to rock it on their job/project. That is the reason why I founded the [Mr Frontend Community](http://mrfrontend.org), everyone, young & old, black & white, male or female, religious or not, it doesn’t matter!

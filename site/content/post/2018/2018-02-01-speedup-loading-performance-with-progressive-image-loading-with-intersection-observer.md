Performance has always been a thing with the Web. Last years we seeing more and more attention for loading performance on the web. 

Big companies like Google, Facebook, Medium and Twitter spending  some extra effort to optimise the user experience in terms of load performance.

## The loading challenge

Last years the web has been exploded on JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Maybe every week there come a few more.

It's a good thing that the web is evolving rapidly. But our users doesn't care if we use ReactJS, VueJS, Angular, Bootstrap or some other framework.

Pushing all those big-ass frameworks, CSS libraries and big images through the line of the users connection can cause big problems. Mainly for the user first, later on companies will feel the effect of users that are not coming back.

People with poor connections and less powerful devices do feel it at first. Some of them have to pay for every byte they download on their device, in order to use our a nice application.

## User experience

Our users care the most about a user-friendly and fast-loading application experience where they can do whatever their ❤️ wants.

So let's make a big jump forwards to our users and send only the necessary things through the line.

Because happy users are the most important thing for a business to grow!

In this article I want to dive into speeding up your loading performance for images. Because it can be a challenge to offer good quality images to our users without compromising to loading  performance and user experience.

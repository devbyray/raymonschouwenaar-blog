We do everything Agile. We embrace the Agile mindset in all the corners of the company, not only the developers, but everyone from PR to HR, from sales to finance. I'm really proud of that!

Lately I did a lot of thinking. Me and my teams build a lot of cool stuf! All our code is on Github (private) repo's.

## Github project management

### Milestones for sprints

You can attach issues to milestones. Milestones can represent sprints. So it is clear which issues are gonna be picked up in which sprint.

When creating a PR you can also attach it to a Milestone. So you can have a fast overview of which features gonna be ready in which sprint.

### Use projects for Scrum-board

#### Organisation board

On the organisation level we can also create a scrum-board. This is super handy for projectmanagment before the team is gonna plan on the features.

In every column you can create a note. A note could be a Epic or a User-story. This note can be converted to a issue and then assigned to a repository.

You would create a note if there is gonna be idea for a new featured. If the idea is final, than it is good to convert it to  a issue. In the issue it is possible to have a discussion about the functionality.

When the User-story-issue is final it can be assigned to a team to implement the new feature.


#### Team board

When a feature is assigned to a team, the team is gonna investigate the functionality and estimate.

When everything is prepared by the team it can be assigned to a sprint (milestone).

When it is the point of starting the sprint, the user-stories inside it can be picked-up.

In the project boards you have columns for
- Todo
- In progress
- Review
- Done
- Impediment

And if you need more steps you can make them yourself!

### Use issues for stories or tasks

- **Story**: Story RSS-109: As a User I want to put a product in the shopping-cart in order to buy a product
- **Task**: Task from RSS-109: Create add to bucket button

### Use labels for status

- Todo
- In progress
- Review
- Done

### Use assignees

If you are a working a lot with tools like GruntJS and GulpJS, your using NodeJS modules. But sometimes you want to re-order the structure of your project directory. But when you want to delete the folder &#8220;node_modules&#8221; on Windows, you get an message that it can not be deleted because the path of file names is to long! (Damn you Windows!)

## Solution

But as a Windows use you can use an handy NodeJS Module. That sound kinda weird right! But you have to install it Globally. And than you never have that problem again!

**Add this to the commandline:** `npm install rimraf -g`

After the installation than go to the parent folder of the &#8220;node_modules&#8221; folder.

**Add this to the commandline:** `rimraf node_modules`

So the folder is now deleted from your project. Sometimes it happens that it takes a while before the task is finished.

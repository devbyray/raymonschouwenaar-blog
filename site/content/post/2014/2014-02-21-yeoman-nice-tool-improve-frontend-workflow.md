Last week i was diving into the world of &#8220;Improve your workflow&#8221;. So after some reading, i found a nice tool called <a title="Yeoman" href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a>. It&#8217;s build to improve your development for especially the frontend. And it has a lots of nice tools an frameworks to spice up your projects.

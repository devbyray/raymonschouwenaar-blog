As an Frontend Developer you got a lot of work to do. You have to create and build fast, but without tools thats not easy. So &#8220;Use good tools&#8221;! Like an carpenter use good tools to craft his home or table, as an Frontend Developer you also have to invest time/money to find good tools to &#8220;Work Faster and Play Harder&#8221; and have a lot of fun!

## Tools, tools and more tools

Yes there are a lot of tools to use for your Frontend work. But which tools let you do your work faster and more efficient? Let me help you to see the trees in the woods of Frontend Development Tools and cut the trees in to pieces!

## Never, ever, ever write plain CSS

Yes you read it right, never ever write plain CSS anymore when you start an new Frontend project. From now on your gonna use CSS-preprocessors. Say what? Yes **CSS-preprocessors**, makes your development process a lot faster. Maybe you&#8217;ve heard about Sass, Compass, Scss or Less. You can use them very easilly. There are a lot of Pro&#8217;s and a lot more tools to use them.

### Cons

It&#8217;s not an real con, but it&#8217;s very important that if your working on an team, the whole team is in to start using an CSS-preprocessor.

### Pros

If you start using CSS-preprocessors you get these pro&#8217;s.

  * You don&#8217;t have to repeat yourself over and over again.
  * You can use **Variable&#8217;s**.
  * You can use **Placeholder classes**
  * You can use an sort of **Functions** (Mixins).
  * You never have to write your own -prefixes-.
  * You can bring more development structure in the files.
  * In the end and minified CSS file.
  * The code of Sass/Scss or Less is more re-useable.

### How to use an CSS-preprocessor.

To use an CSS-preprocessor you need an application or taskrunner to build (compile) your CSS file(s). The most junior Frontend Developers will use install-able application&#8217;s. But the more grown Frontend Developers will use taskrunners. Because the taskrunners can do a lot more than compile your CSS-preprocessor. I use Grunt and Gulp with Sass/Scss for my own development for example. But you can find your own in the list below (free and paid) to use for the compiling of your CSS.

#### Sass & Less

  * [Koala][1] _Free_, _Non-command-line_
  * [Prepros][2] _Free & Paid_, _Non-command-line_
  * [Codekit][3] _Free Trail & Paid_, _Non-command-line_
  * [Mixture][4] _Free Trail & Paid_, _Non-command-line_

#### Sass

  * [Scout.app][5] _Free_, _Non-command-line_
  * [Compass.app][6] _Paid_, _Non-command-line_ (Very easy to use for beginners)

#### Less

  * [Crunchapp][7] _Free_, _Non-command-line_
  * [SimpLESS][8] _Free_, _Non-command-line_
  * [Online Less Compiler][9] _Free_, _Non-command-line_
  * [WinLess][10] _Free_, _Non-command-line_

### Getting started with CSS-preprocessor

Every where you search on the web are good article&#8217;s about how to getting started to use Sass or Less. So it doesn&#8217;t make sense to write one here for you. The list below helps to to getting started!

#### Sass

## Use taskrunners!

The are free to use! But the most important, you can use them for more than CSS-preprocessors only. For example: You can use them for minifing your JavaScript, compressing your images, auto reload the browser when you hit _save_ or use it for an Frontend template engine.

#### Gulp taskrunner

  * [Gulp Sass][19] _Free_, _Command line tool_
  * [Gulp Less][20] _Free_, _Command line tool_

#### Grunt taskrunner

  * [Grunt Sass][21] _Free_, _Command line tool_
  * [Grunt Less][22] _Free_, _Command line tool_

### Grunt or Gulp

So you decided to use an taskrunner? Great! You become an more professional Frontend Developer! But yeah your next question will be, should i use Grunt or Gulp? That&#8217;s for everyone to decide himself.

I first started to use Grunt in an combination with [Yeoman][23]. But after a few months i discovered Gulp, after some trying i feld more comfortable with Gulp. But sometimes is use them both for differtent projects.

But to help you to make that decision is link you to an [good presentation][24] of Mark Dalgleish. He tells you more about Grunt and Gulp so you can check which you want to use.

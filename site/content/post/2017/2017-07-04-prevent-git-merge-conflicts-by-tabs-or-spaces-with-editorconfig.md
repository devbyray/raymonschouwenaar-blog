If you ever worked in a team with developers, you soon find out they maybe use different editors, (IDEâ€™s) with different settings than yours.

But you are a big fan of linting and reviewing code in Github or other Git system, but everytime someone checks-in code, there are massive merge-conflicts because of different settings for the indenting.

If you use tabs and a developer from your team is using spaces by default, it will soon become a merge-conflict hell!

But of course, there is a very quick fix for it!

## Editorconfig

The editorconfig is supported across multiple editors and platforms.

By putting this file in your project, most editors will change the config by default.

There is a great introduction playlist on youtube you should definitely watch if you want to see how it works.

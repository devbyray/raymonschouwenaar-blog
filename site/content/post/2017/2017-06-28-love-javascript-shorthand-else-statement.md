So there it is! It is a long time ago that I put online a new blog post! Did a lot of other stuff then Web Development. But this time I want to share a small nice trick in JavaScript!

Yes, I love the JavaScript shorthand of the if-else statement. (_For the record, the let variable is_ an ES6_Â type variable._) Check the super simple example below.

```javascript
  let aVar = 'A';
  let conditionalVariable = aVar === 'A' ? true : false;
```

This example is super simple. I use this most of the times when the value of a variable needs to be based on the other variable.

In the early days of me writing an if-else statement in JavaScript was more like this:

```javascript
  var aVar = 'A';
  if(aVar === 'A') {
    var conditionalVariable = true;
  } else {
    var conditionalVariable = false;
  }
```

But since DRY (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself) is a good thing to keep in mind, this is not the best code! In some cases, the normal If-else statement is more readable.

But for very simple tasks like my top example, it is less code.

**Bonus**

As a bonus, I want to show that this does also work very good in Angular template expressions.

```html
  &lt;strong&gt;{{COMPONENT.incomeType === 'SELF_EMPLOYED' ? 'Self employed' : 'Employed'}}&lt;/strong&gt;
```

This will avoid writing multiple HTML tags with ng-if&#8217;s:

```html
  &lt;strong ng-if="COMPONENT.incomeType === 'SELF_EMPLOYED"&gt;
      Self employed
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong ng-if="COMPONENT.incomeType !== 'SELF_EMPLOYED'"&gt;
      Employed
  &lt;/strong&gt;
```

So hopefully this is gonna help you with writing better DRY JavaScript code!

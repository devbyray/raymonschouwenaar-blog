If you are working on a cool React Native app, I guess you want to make to look-and-feel completely to your own design.

Well, the launch screen is the first thing a user see. The first look must be the best!

So letâ€™s create a splash screen for your React Native in Xcode, so your user doesnâ€™t see that ugly default screen that React Native show by default in iOS.

  1. Open your project in Xcode.
  2. On the left sidebar, click the folder icon.

  3. Open the dropdown
  4. Open the first folder

  5. Click the file LaunchScreen.xib

There is the default launch screen. Here you can edit the text, change colors, add images and a lot more.

Iâ€™m not gonna teach you how to create a nice and fancy launch screen, but this is the spot to use your own imagination!<figure>

Looking forwards to all the cool launch screens you will make ðŸ˜€

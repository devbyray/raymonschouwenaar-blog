It happens a lot that you need to loop over an Array with JavaScript Objects! But sometimes you just donâ€™t know what kind of properties that Object has. Lucky we are that JavaScript offers a few ways of looping over JavaScript Object properties.

<!--more-->

I wanted to share 3 of them with you. So hopefully this will help you in the right direction.

## The Object to loop over

First, we need an example object to loop over. So I put some of my experience in it ðŸ˜‰ (hahaha)! Keep the fun in it!

```javascript
    let experienceObject = {
        name: 'Raymon',
        title: 'Lead Frontend/JavaScript Developer',
        yearsExperience: 8,
        projects: [
            {
                name: 'ANWB',
                title: 'Senior JavaScript Developer',
                techniques: ['Angular', 'ES6', 'Vanilla JavaScript', 'Less', 'CSS']
            },
            {
                name: 'NATO',
                title: 'Lead JavaScript Developer',
                techniques: ['Angular 2', 'AngularJS', 'ES6', 'Vanilla JavaScript', 'Web Sockets', 'D3']
            },
            {
                name: 'Rabobank',
                title: 'Senior Frontend Developer',
                techniques: ['Vanilla JavaScript', 'CSS', 'Responsive Webdesign']
            }
        ]
    }
```

## Object.keys(experienceObject).map()

The first example is the Object.keys map method to loop over the properties of the Object it.

```javascript
    Object.keys(experienceObject).map(e =&gt; {
        console.log(`key= ${e} value = ${experienceObject[e]}`)
    });
```

## Object.entries(experienceObject).forEach()

The second example is the Object.keys with the forEach method over the properties of the Object it.

```javascript
    Object.entries(experienceObject).forEach(([key, value]) =&gt; {
        console.log(`key= ${key} value = ${value}`)
    })
```

## For-in loop

The last example is the For-in loop to loop over the properties of the Object it.

```javascript
    for (property in experienceObject) {
    console.log(`key= ${property} value = ${experienceObject[property]}`)
    }
```

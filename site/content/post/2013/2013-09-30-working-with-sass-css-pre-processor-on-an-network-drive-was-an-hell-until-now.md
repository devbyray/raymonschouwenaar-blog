**Sass & Zurb Foundation Framework**
  
Since a few months i use Sass as my Css Pre-Processor (togheter with <a title="Zurb Foundation Framework Sass" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html" target="_blank">Zurb Foundation Framework</a>) for all my projects because it give&#8217;s me a huge jump-start in the building process. I created a lot of mix-in&#8217;s that makes my life a lot easier as an developer. But after i buy a nice NAS of Synology the hell start&#8217;s for me!

**Network drive**
  
To compile my code i use <a href="http://compass.handlino.com/" target="_blank">Compass-app</a>, i like that because it&#8217;s super easy in use and works very fast! But when all my files where stored on my NAS, it took 1 min when Compass-app compiled my Sass code to Css. It was like hell came down!

**Hell came down**
  
So i stared searching on Google if some one has that same problem. But i didn&#8217;t find an answer or tool that could help me out. So after hours of searching and thinking, iÂ thought myself that compiling my Sass was no-problem when i worked on my local drive.

**So heaven came down**
  
So i decided to compile my Sass code on my local drive in an separated folder, and than sync (with this <a href="http://synkron.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">easy free sync software</a>) the Css to my project folder on my Network drive.

**Better idea&#8217;s?**
  
Do you have better idea&#8217;s or did i miss an solution? Please write it down in the comments, so every developer can make use of it! Thanks!

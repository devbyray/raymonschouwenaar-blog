Many WordPress Themes where build with an handy option. An options where you can paste your Google Analytics code. First when i saw that i thought he that&#8217;s very useful. So i decided to build the same option in the theme i made custom for my clients.

But now e few months later, i&#8217;ll realize that when a client switch to an other theme he must place that Google Analytics code again in his new theme. And that&#8217;s not very client friendly, also it&#8217;s not nice to do always the same thing when i made a new website for an client.

### Add your Google Analytics code!

So for every one who need an free WordPress plugin, to set his Google Analytics code for once and for ever on the right place. I&#8217;ve created the simple plugin &#8220;<a title="Download the Add your Google Analytics code!" href="http://raymonschouwenaar.nl/freebies/plugins/wp-google-analytics-plugin.zip" target="_blank"><strong>Add your Google Analytics code!</strong></a>&#8221; on the first place for free usage for every WordPress website, but for myself to! Because, i like to change my website a lot. So this is the perfect solution.

Did the plugin not work for you? Or did it the awesome job you expected? I like to know in the comments. If you like the plugin, please share it with all your facebook and twitter followers!

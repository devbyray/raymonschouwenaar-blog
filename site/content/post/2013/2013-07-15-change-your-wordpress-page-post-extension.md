Sometimes you wanna change the page & post extension. Maybe for some reasons for SEO, or maybe for your cliënt.

Today i was searching for an plugin to change my page and post extension, but when i was searching on <a title="Tag Google" href="http://www.raymonschouwenaar.nl/tag/google/" target="_blank">Google</a>, i could only find an plugin who out-of-date. So after searching the <a title="Tag WordPress" href="http://www.raymonschouwenaar.nl/tag/wordpress/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> Codex, i&#8217;ll find an small powerfull <a title="Tag Plugin" href="http://www.raymonschouwenaar.nl/tag/plugin/" target="_blank">plugin</a>.

Change your page extensions
  
The &#8220;<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-page-extensions/" target="_blank">Custom Page Extension</a>&#8221; plugin is the easiest plugin for your page extensions. Just add &#8220;html&#8221; without a &#8220;.&#8221;, click save and i&#8217;ts allready working (after you install the plugin of-course).

Change you post extensions
  
Changing you&#8217;re post extension in even much easier, because WordPress allready supported it in the permalink option&#8217;s. So go to the Settings -> Permalink. There you must past the snippet, after you click on save, it&#8217;s working.

[code type=&#8221;php&#8221;] /%postname%.html/ [/code]

That&#8217;s just so easy! If you got any problem&#8217;s to get this working? Then you could add an comment, or ask me on twitter <a title="Twitter Raymon Schouwenaar" href="https://twitter.com/#!/rsschouwenaar" target="_blank">@rsschouwenaar</a>.

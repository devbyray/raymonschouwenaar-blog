So it seems that i was trying to push an tag that already exists in the remote repository. But how you can avoid this? This solution worked for me!

When you want to push your changes with Sourcetree. Un-select the &#8220;Push all tags&#8221; option. So you avoid to get this error.

If you have any questions or comments on this solution? Or did it helped you? Please add them below! ðŸ™‚

# How I helped a Junior Frontend Developer, to get better!

**First Note:** I&#8217;m not writing this to be arrogant, or to let you think I&#8217;m the best there is. I hoping to help and inspire others with this post.

Maybe weird that I didn&#8217;t posted this earlier, but I&#8217;ve seen in the couple of months, that the guys I helped and coached with Frontend related stuff are now so much better than the where!

At the end of October I was working at a nice company in the Netherlands. The where building a huge world-wide platform, create website&#8217;s for all there member-firms. The team I worked with was supercool. Mostly the where backend developer.

One day the architect of the team asked me to have a chat in private. There was a guy at the company, who wanted to be better at Frontend Development. So he asked me to help and coach him a bit. That question was making me so happy! I love to help people that want to grow there skills in Frontend Development. I said yes, to help and coach him. 🙂

The other morning I got an email of that guy. He was explaining that he wanted to be a better Frontend Developer, but also if I had some topics he could read in his own time, to get up-to-date.

Hell yeah! Someone who wants to learn and is passionated! Offcourse I wanted to help him! I wanted to type a quick email, but that wasn&#8217;t that short. Hahaha 🙂 Everything I could possibly think of, to help him, I included in the email. So this is what I send. (I translated it from Dutch, and kept the name private, for privacy)

_Hi (name of the guy),_

_Thanks for you nice email. I&#8217;m always willing to help others to get better in Frontend Development ? So you got the right person!_

_(name of the architect) asked me yester to help and guide you, so definitly gonna do that!! ?_

_Next monday I&#8217;m at the office, so if you come and say Hi, we could have a chat._

_But in meanwhile here is a list that you could use to dive more into Frontend tooling and other handy Frontend sources._

  * __**To start** I would advice you to read the article &#8220;<a href="http://csswizardry.com/2014/08/advice-to-budding-front-end-developers/" target="_blank">Advice to budding Frontend Deverlopers</a>&#8221; from CSSwizardy. That was a big motivation for me. ?__
  * _**CSS Pre-processors:** CSS pre-processors will help you to write the CSS easier and faster. For example you could use &#8220;variables&#8221; and &#8220;functions (mixins)&#8221;. Sass and Less are the most famous CSS pre-processors, but I prefer Sass. That is the reason why I would advice you to get familiar with Sass._ 
      * __**Links:** &#8220;<a href="http://vanseodesign.com/css/introduction-to-sass-part-1/" target="_blank">Introduction to Sass part 1</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://vanseodesign.com/css/introduction-to-sass-part2/" target="_blank">Introduction to Sass part 2</a>&#8221; & &#8220;<a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/08/5-reasons-you-should-be-using-sass-today/" target="_blank">5 reasons why you should using Sass today</a>&#8220;__
  * _**Naming methodologies:** Naming methodologies are used to get more structure in the way you choose your CSS classes. Because naming CSS classes will sometimes be harder than you think! There are a lot of different methodologiesL BEM, OOCSS, SUITCSS, SMACSS and Atomic Design. I prefer BEM for creating easy to understand CSS classes, so I would advice you to read about it and try it out. But to start I would advice you to checkout BEM, you can use that right away next time your writing CSS._

  * _**Frontend Workflow (automation):** There are 2 popular Frontend taksrunners (in my oppinion): GulpJS & GruntJS. The are build on top of NodeJS. These taskrunners will help you to speed up your workflow, but also automate a lot of things. Think about the idea: &#8220;When you save your CSS, the browser automagicly refresh the browser&#8221;, &#8220;Create a minified version of the Javascript&#8221;, &#8220;Prefix the CSS automagicly in seconds&#8221;, &#8220;Create HTML include&#8217;s. Like you could do with PHP&#8221;._

_So with that list, you will have enough for the weekend! My biggest advice to get better in Frontend Developement is: Read a couple of times during the week and weekend articles about CSS, Sass, HTML5, Javascript, Frontend Tooling etc._

_If you need some help, please let me know! ?_

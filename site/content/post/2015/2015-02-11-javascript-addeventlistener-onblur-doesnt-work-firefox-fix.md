For a cool project is was building an Email validation script. But Firefox got some weird thing with the &#8220;onblur&#8221; event. Since I&#8217;ve decided to leave jQuery behind, and make more use of (Vanilla) JavaScript, i got this problem that my code wasn&#8217;t working.

**Example 1: Doesn&#8217;t work:**

    // HTML
    Enter your name: <input type="text" id="fname">

    <p>When you leave the input field, a function is triggered which transforms the input text to upper case.</p>


    // JavaScript
    document.getElementById('fname').addEventListener('onblur', function() {
    input.value = input.value.toUpperCase();
    });


**Example 2: Does work:**

    // HTML
    Enter your name: <input type="text" id="fname" onblur="myFunction()">

    <p>When you leave the input field, a function is triggered which transforms the input text to upper case.</p>


    // JavaScript
    function myFunction() {
        var x = document.getElementById("fname");
        x.value = x.value.toUpperCase();
    }


The &#8220;onblur&#8221; event worked on every other browser, except Firefox. Even on the website of [W3schools][1] the report that the onblur event should work in Firefox, but it doesn&#8217;t. After a lot of testing and searching i saw there was also the &#8220;blur&#8221; event.

So i thought, I could try the &#8220;blur&#8221; event. And magically it works!!

**Solution:**

    document.getElementById('fname').addEventListener('onblur', function() {
    input.value = input.value.toUpperCase();
    });

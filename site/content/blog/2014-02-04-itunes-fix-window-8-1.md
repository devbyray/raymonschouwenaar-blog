When i updated my computer to Windows 8.1 and want to startup Itunes, i got an very nasty error! So after some searching it&#8217;s pretty easy to fix. So i thought maybe you have the same problem. That&#8217;s why i publish the solution here 🙂

Hope you can fix yours to with this easy fix:

  1. Copy **QTMovieWin.dll** from:  **C:Program Files (x86)Common FilesAppleApple Application Support**
  2. to: **C:Program Files (x86)iTunes**

Now you&#8217;re error would be fixed. If not, restart your computer!

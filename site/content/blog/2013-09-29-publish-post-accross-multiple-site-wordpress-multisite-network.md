For myself is was searching for a plugin that easily publish post accross multiple site in an WordPress Multisite Network. But every plugin i found was only broadcasting the post on the other website.

But then i found this plugin &#8220;<a href="http://leondoornkamp.nl/wp-multisite-post/" target="_blank">WP Multisite Post</a>&#8221; created by <a href="http://leondoornkamp.nl/" target="_blank">Leon Doornkamp</a>. After installing this plugin and set the settings for the right (custom)posts & page&#8217;s, it was ready for using!

When you create an post in Site 1, you can choose in the metabox &#8220;Multi Sites&#8221; in which other website you wanna publish the post. After publishing the post, you can switch to Site 2 and there you can change the post content. But on Site 1 it will not change the content, that&#8217;s what i needed!

Hope if you found this blog post, to share it with others, so that the can use the plugin to!

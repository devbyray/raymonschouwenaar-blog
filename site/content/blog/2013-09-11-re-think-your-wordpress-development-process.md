A few weeks ago i was busy toÂ re-think my WordPress theme development process. I&#8217;ve a great experience with WordPress theme development and a bit with WordPress plugin development. But i always wanna develop and organize my structure better and better.

So i came with the idea in mind of creating an custom WordPress plugin with all great functions, to separate my custom functions for Custom post type&#8217;s, Shortcode&#8217;s and more like that, from my HTML and PHP for the WordPress theme. So with that in mind i started searching for article&#8217;s about that.

I had expect that more people came on that idea, but i notice it wasn&#8217;t. Or only a few people published it on there website. So after a few article&#8217;s i decided to make my own manner of go to an higher level in my WordPress development.

## Create a custom WordPress plugin every project?

The reason i decided to create an custom WordPress plugin every time i created an custom WordPress theme is pretty simple!

**Re-using
  
** Never find out the wheel again! If you created some function&#8217;s for an other project for one of your client&#8217;s. than you could copy and paste. So you could re-use the functionality instead of spending again 2 ours you already spend with an difficult function. No you could spend some time for more important or difficult functionality&#8217;s.

**Don&#8217;t loose data with an theme-switch!
  
** If you switch an theme in you&#8217;re WordPress installation. You will discover soon that the if you had an theme option like, adding an Google Analytics code to your website, that data is lost if you activated an other theme. So you gonna hurry to add this code to the theme editor and past the code there. But an future theme-switch will give you the same problem! So build this example functionality in an custom WordPress plugin, and you have no problem&#8217;s with this issue in the future! *Google Analytics code was only an example. You couldÂ imagine this by Facebook or Twitter url&#8217;s the same!

**Don&#8217;t loose your Custom Post type data & metafields!
  
** OkÃ© i know! You could think that data is never lost! That&#8217;s true, your database will save it. But it will not be accessible or editable with the WordPress Admin. And that&#8217;s not very friendly! So register your Custom Post Type&#8217;s, Metaboxes and Metafields in an custom WordPress plugin, and it will be accessible from the Admin after an theme-switch!

**It&#8217;s not more difficult!
  
** Some will think that creating an WordPress plugin is more difficult than creating an custom WordPress theme. But that isn&#8217;t true! It is equally easy! So let this reason not hold you back from re-think your WordPress development process.

So this is the reason why i decided this! But off-course these reasons are only a few, but i&#8217;ll think there the most important reasons to consider to change you&#8217;re WordPress theme development process.

If some one think that i&#8217;m wrong with this vision of WordPress Theme development, i&#8217;ll will ask you to add it in the comment&#8217;s! But if someone like the idea? I like to know it to! My idea is not the number one solution to fix all you&#8217;re problems, but it can make the development process more clear. And your theme structure will be more clear to!

I hope you like to read my vision on this! If so? Share it ðŸ™‚

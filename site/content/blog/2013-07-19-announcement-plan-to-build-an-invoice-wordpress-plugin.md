A couple months ago i conceived the idea to challenging myself in the knowledge of programming for WordPress, to build an plugin where i can make Invoice with. The idea was only the plugin for the purpose to build my knowledge in WordPress Plugin development.

But because the work i&#8217;ve got from my clients was so much, that i&#8217;ve got no time to develop the invoice plugin further. And a few months later i almost forgot the plugin because of my business.

A few weeks ago, a client send me an email with the question, if i did know an WordPress plugin where he could make his invoice with. An can send to his clients, and make the clients could login, see the invoice&#8217;s and download them. But also where the client can have a archive of all the invoice&#8217;s, and can see which invoice is paid and which not. And at the top of the iceberg a client must have the opertunety to paid online the invoice with paypal, creditcard, iDeal (a standard online payment service in the Netherlands).

I thought uhmmm i don&#8217;t know any plugin who can do all that stuff! But then i remember my idea of the invoice plugin. So began with plan to develop the plugin further. When i told my client that i would build it myself, he was very happy! And i love to make my clients happy! That&#8217;s give me an so happy feeling!

That&#8217;s why i wanna announce with this blog that i&#8217;m making plans to build the plugin this year! I&#8217;ll hope to get it finished on december 2013, but maybe it could take more time. So if you wanna be up-to-date about the &#8220;WP Client Invoice Hero&#8221; (because that&#8217;s gonna be the name of the plugin) subscribe to the comments below.

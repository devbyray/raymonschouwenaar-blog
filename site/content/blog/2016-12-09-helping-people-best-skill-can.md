Since I started the <a href="http://mrfrontend.rog" target="_blank">Mr Frontend Community</a>, I noticed that I helped a lot of people. Not to lift me above others! No, I really discovered for myself that, helping others brought me a lot good things this year.

As a kid, I always had a natural feeling for helping others. I helped friends, family, classmates. In every age in my life, I helped people with different things. My classmates with cooking lessons. I helped my grandmother with her grocery. Later on, I helped other classmates with some Photoshop or Indesign stuff, even when the got higher rewards because of my help.

Because I helped people so much, I grew in my skills on all kinds of fields. I wanted to be very good in Web Development at a young age. And every day I got better and better. I started helping others with that. In order to help others, even if you don’t know everything about the topic, forced me to dive more deeply into it.

## Help others to grow your own skills

Because it forced me (by passion) to dive more deeply into Web Development, it became easier to help others. Nowadays with the Mr Frontend Community, I raised the bars with my passion for helping others. Some questions I got, I don’t know the answer to it. But I make sure that most of the time, I find the answer.

What I want to tell with all of this. If you want to grow in whatever skill, please help others who struggle with it, it definitely gonna help the other, but also yourself!

You don’t have to be super experienced! You don’t have to have all the answers! And sometimes you just have to say, “I don’t know”. But always make sure, you will find the answer!

## Mentoring and teaching

When you become on a higher level, where you are very steady in your knowledge, you can start coaching and teaching.

That is one of the nicest things that exist! But still, it doesn’t mean you know everything. It just doesn&#8217;t mean you can’t learn anything from someone who is just starting.

Even better, sometimes people who are just starting and don’t have that much experience, look different to things than you do. That can help you change your perspective on things you even didn’t notice before.

There are also a lot of developers out there, who know a lot more than me! I’m glad to! So that means, I can still learn! 🙂

## Don’t think to low of yourself

My message to those who are doubting on there knowledge on topics they want to grow in. Never say to yourself I’m just not good enough! Also to those who have so many experience in their field, don’t say to less experienced people, I’m better than you, so you are not good enough!

Always think you can learn from anyone! Every experience person started one day!

Everyone is good enough and everyone can learn! It doesn’t matter how experience you are.

_Well this is not only to apply to people in the Web Development industry. You can apply this on any field!_

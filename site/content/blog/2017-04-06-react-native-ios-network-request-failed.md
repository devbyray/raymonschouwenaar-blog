By default iOS isn&#8217;t supporting HTTP requests, only HTTPS requests are allowed.

But what if you have an API that only works with HTTP, you can easily change the setting&#8217;s to support HTTP requests.

When I first tried to do a request to an HTTP address it gave me the error &#8220;Network Request Failed&#8221;. I couldn&#8217;t get why.

But after some digging, I figured iOS was only supporting HTTPS.

To change this, open the &#8220;info.plist&#8221;. You can find this at &#8216;ios/ProjectName&#8217;.

Search for `<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>`. If it&#8217;s there already you only need to this code below it:

    <br /><dict>
        <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
    
    

Now close your simulator and kill the running process (if you already started it). Run react-native run-ios again, and now your iOS app will support HTTP calls.

Hope this will help to fix your problem with React Native ðŸ™‚
